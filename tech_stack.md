# Tech Stack for Wedding Band Song Request App

## Overview

This document outlines the technology stack used for the Wedding Band Song Request App. The application utilizes Python for the backend with Flask, PostgreSQL as the database, and React.js for the frontend.

## Backend

### Python

- **Framework**: Flask
  - **Purpose**: Flask is a lightweight and flexible microframework used to build the backend API, handle business logic, and manage data interactions. It provides simplicity and modularity for developing web applications.
  - **Features**:
    - RESTful API development
    - Integration with SQLAlchemy
    - Middleware and routing
    - Flexible configuration

### PostgreSQL

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - **Purpose**: PostgreSQL is used as the relational database for storing application data. It supports complex queries and transactions, making it suitable for robust data management.
  - **Features**:
    - ACID compliance
    - Advanced querying capabilities
    - Data integrity and security

## Frontend

### React.js

- **Library**: React.js
  - **Purpose**: React.js is used to build the user interface of the application. It enables the development of dynamic and interactive web applications with reusable UI components.
  - **Features**:
    - Component-based architecture
    - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
    - State management and lifecycle methods
    - Integration with RESTful APIs for dynamic data fetching

## Communication Between Frontend and Backend

- **API Communication**:
  - **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS
  - **Format**: JSON
  - **Description**: The frontend (React.js) communicates with the backend (Flask) using RESTful APIs. Data is exchanged in JSON format to ensure a smooth and efficient integration.

## Development and Deployment

### Development Tools

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
  - **Extensions**: Prettier, ESLint, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git
  - **Repository Hosting**: GitHub

## Summary

This tech stack provides a robust and scalable solution for building the Wedding Band Song Request App. Python with Flask handles the backend logic, PostgreSQL ensures reliable data storage, and React.js creates an engaging frontend experience. The combination of these technologies allows for a seamless and interactive user experience, with efficient data management and a responsive UI.
